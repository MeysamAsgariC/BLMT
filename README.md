In this repository, you can find the tweet ids and features extracted for the hand labeled 5k dataset.

In the `Obfuscated Data` zip file, you can find the xlsx, json and csv formats of the obfuscated data. In these files, ID means the tweet ids; which are also in the ids folder, which means the user can only crawl the needed dataset. 

In order to reference and learn more about the dataset, you can use the following bibtex and link to read the paper:
